# Interactive Comment Section Code Review

# Aka Our Space

When two devs Hamdi Kamel and myself Davonne Vigil get togehter and collaberate. Taking Hamdi's code, reviewing it, reading it, understanding what he did, breaking it, and turned it into something totally new when it comes to the UI.

# Goal ðŸŽ¯

- My goal out of this code review was to go in blindly and see what I can understand, see what I know, and testing my skills. Especailly when it comes to TypeScript.

- I went into this project, wanting to style it and put my own twist to it. The project transformed into "Our Space", inspired by Myspace.com Comment Section styled in Tailwind CSS.

- It was a lot of fun and also confusing. Got stuck a few times, figuring out all the TypeScript and saw what code went where, and understanding how its all connected. I am happy the way this project turned out! It was awesome working with Hamdi!
