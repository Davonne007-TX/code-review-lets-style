# Interactive Comment Section Code Review

# Aka Our Space

- When two devs Hamdi Kamel and Davonne Vigil get togehter and collab. Taking Hamdi Kamel code, reviewing it, reading it, understanding what he did, and turned it into something new.

- My goal out of this code review was to go in blindly and see what I can understand, see what I know, and testing my skills. Especailly when it comes to TypeScript.

- I went into this project, wanting to style it and put my own twist to it. I tuned it into "Our Space", inspired by Myspace.com Comment Section styled in Tailwind CSS.

- It was a lot of fun and also confusing. Got stuck a few times but in the end I am happy the way it turned out.
